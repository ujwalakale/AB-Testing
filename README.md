# AB-Testing
Analyze A/B Test Results via A/B tests are ususally performed by Data analysts and Data Scientists inorder to make decision on a particular feature as the name suggest i.e. feature A or feature B .
For e.g. i worked for this project in Udacity where i was trying to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. 
The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. 
My goal was to work through jupyter notebook and analyse the data provided and help the company to understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
